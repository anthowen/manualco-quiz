## Introduction

At Manual we sometimes create landing pages to better explain our value proposition to users
who land on these from ads. As an experiment, we’ve decided to create a landing page that will
include a quiz, which will guide users through deciding if Manual is good for them.

## Tech stack

- Bootstrapped with [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Stage management with [Zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand)
- Animation with [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos)
- *SCSS*

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
